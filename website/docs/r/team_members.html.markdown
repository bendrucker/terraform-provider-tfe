# tfe_team_members

Manages users in a team.

~> **NOTE** on managing team memberships: Terraform currently provides three
resources for managing team memberships.
The [tfe_team_organization_member](team_organization_member.html) resource is
the preferred way. The [tfe_team_member](team_member.html)
resource can be used multiple times as it manages the team membership for a
single user.  The [tfe_team_members](team_members.html) resource, on the other
hand, is used to manage all team memberships for a specific team and can only be
used once. All three resources cannot be used for the same team simultaneously.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```hcl
resource "tfe_team" "test" {
  name         = "my-team-name"
  organization = "my-org-name"
}

resource "tfe_team_members" "test" {
  team_id   = "${tfe_team.test.id}"
  usernames = ["admin", "sander"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `team_id` - (Required) ID of the team.
* `usernames` - (Required) Names of the users to add.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - The ID of the team.

## Import

Team members can be imported; use `<TEAM ID>` as the import ID. For example:

```shell
terraform import tfe_team_members.test team-47qC3LmA47piVan7
```
