## Requirements

-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.10.x
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.11 (to build the provider plugin)

## Building The Provider

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-tfe`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers
$ git clone git@github.com:terraform-providers/terraform-provider-tfe
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-tfe
$ make build
```

## Using the provider

For production use, you should constrain the acceptable provider versions via configuration,
to ensure that new versions with breaking changes will not be automatically installed by 
`terraform init` in future. As this provider is still at version zero, you should constrain 
the acceptable provider versions on the minor version.

If you are using Terraform CLI version 0.12.x, you can constrain this provider to 0.15.x versions 
by adding a `required_providers` block inside a `terraform` block.
```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    tfe = "~> 0.15.0"
  }
}
```

If you are using Terraform CLI version 0.11.x, you can constrain this provider to 0.15.x versions 
by adding the version constraint to the tfe provider block.
```
provider "tfe" {
  version = "~> 0.15.0"
  ...
}
```

For more information on constraining provider versions, see the 
[provider versions documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#provider-versions).

If you're building the provider, follow the instructions to
[install it as a plugin.](https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/basics.html#installing-a-plugin)
After placing it into your plugins directory,  run `terraform init` to initialize it.

## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed
on your machine (version 1.11+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a
[GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary
in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ make build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-tfe
...
```

## Testing

### 1. (Optional) Create a policy sets repo

If you are planning to run the full suite of tests or work on policy sets, you'll need to set up a policy set repository in GitHub.

Your policy set repository will need the following: 
1. A policy set stored in a subdirectory
1. A branch other than master
   
### 2. Set up environment variables

To run all tests, you will need to set the following environment variables:

##### Required:
A hostname and token must be provided in order to run the acceptance tests. By
default, these are loaded from the the `credentials` in the [CLI config
file](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/cli-config.html). You can override
these values with the environment variables specified below: 

1. `TFE_HOSTNAME` - URL of a Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise instance to be used for testing, without the scheme. Example: `tfe.local`
1. `TFE_TOKEN` - A [user API token](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/users.html#api-tokens) for an administrator account on the Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise instance being used for testing.

##### Optional:
1. `TFE_USER1` and `TFE_USER2`: The usernames of two pre-existing users on the Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise instance being used for testing. Required for running team membership tests.
1. `GITHUB_TOKEN` - [GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line). Used to establish a VCS provider connection.
1. `GITHUB_POLICY_SET_IDENTIFIER` - GitHub policy set repository identifier in the format `username/repository`. Required for running policy set tests.
1. `GITHUB_POLICY_SET_BRANCH`: A GitHub branch for the repository specified by `GITHUB_POLICY_SET_IDENTIFIER`. Required for running policy set tests.
1. `GITHUB_POLICY_SET_PATH`: A GitHub subdirectory for the repository specified by `GITHUB_POLICY_SET_IDENTIFIER`. Required for running policy set tests.

You can set your environment variables up however you prefer. The following are instructions for setting up environment variables using [envchain](https://github.com/sorah/envchain).
   1. Make sure you have envchain installed. [Instructions for this can be found in the envchain README](https://github.com/sorah/envchain#installation).
   1. Pick a namespace for storing your environment variables. I suggest `terraform-provider-tfe` or something similar.
   1. For each environment variable you need to set, run the following command:
      ```sh
      envchain --set YOUR_NAMESPACE_HERE ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_HERE
      ```
      **OR**
    
      Set all of the environment variables at once with the following command:
      ```sh
      envchain --set YOUR_NAMESPACE_HERE TFE_HOSTNAME TFE_TOKEN TFE_USER1 TFE_USER2 GITHUB_TOKEN GITHUB_POLICY_SET_IDENTIFIER GITHUB_POLICY_SET_BRANCH GITHUB_POLICY_SET_PATH
      ```

### 3. Run the tests

#### Running the provider tests

##### With envchain:
```sh
$ envchain YOUR_NAMESPACE_HERE make test
```

##### Without envchain:
```sh
$ make test
```

#### Running all the acceptance tests

##### With envchain:
```sh
$ envchain YOUR_NAMESPACE_HERE make testacc
```

##### Without envchain:
```sh
$ make testacc
```

#### Running specific acceptance tests 

The commands below use notification configurations as an example.

##### With envchain:
```sh
$ TESTARGS="-run TestAccTFENotificationConfiguration" envchain YOUR_NAMESPACE_HERE make testacc
```

##### Without envchain:
```sh
$ TESTARGS="-run TestAccTFENotificationConfiguration" make testacc
```   

### 4. Referencing a local version of `go-tfe`

You may want to run tests against a local version of `go-tfe`. Add the following line to `go.mod` above the require statement, using your local path to `go-tfe`.

```
replace github.com/hashicorp/go-tfe => /path-to-local-repo/go-tfe
```
